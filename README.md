# gravityforms_staticcontentaddon
A gravityforms addon which allows to display page content within forms.

As an alternative to the HTML-Element, this addon adds a new custom field, which allows to select a previously created page.
The page content is then rendered together with the form.

This might be ideal, if you have to do a multipaged form with static contents.

## Compatiblity
- Works with WPML!
- Works with any Pagebuilder, which uses the content field of your post-type.
